# LetterSection

A letterboxd-api-consuming app for figuring out what movie to watch with your friends.

## Dev Setup

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Because this project is so small on the frontend, I'm forgoing tests for now.

For more on Nuxt.js, the frontend framework used in this project, check out the [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
